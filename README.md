# n3 DevOps Test

## Mini Rest API (api.py)
Write a python3 script that starts up a RESTfull application and listen to HTTP request on port 5000. Use redis to store data .
You must create two endpoints ​/key ​and​ /key/<KEY>​ which support two verbs:

- PUT /key​: create a redis key with the key/value coming from the body.

The below command must have the similar output than ​"redis-cli set key1 value1" curl -XPUT h​ ttp://HOST/key​ -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"key": "key1", "value":
"value1"}'
On success reply a 202 status and 500 in case of an error.

- GET /key/<KEY>​: will retrieve the key name and value in the following json format: '{"key": "key1", "value": "value1"}' with a status code of 200. If the key can not be found you must reply a 404 with no data.


## Dockerfile
Create a Dockerfile which is running the project created in step 1.

## Docker-compose file
Create a docker-compose file which will allow us to bring the project up. We should be able to query the api via ​http://localhost:5000​. Redis must not run in the same container the python project

## Terraform AWS ECS
Create a terraform directory which will contain the configuration files and bring the project live into Amazon ECS.
Bonus: Use remote state file.
